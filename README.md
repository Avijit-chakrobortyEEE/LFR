# LFR
# Introduction

The Line Follower Robot is an autonomous vehicle that follows a predefined path using sensors to detect and follow a line. It is widely used in industrial automation, warehouse management, and robotic competitions.

# Features

Uses IR sensors to detect the path.

Microcontroller-based control system (Arduino, Raspberry Pi, etc.).

Can navigate along a predefined track.

Adjustable speed and sensitivity.

Obstacle detection and avoidance (optional feature).

# Components Used

Microcontroller: Arduino Uno / Raspberry Pi / ESP32

Motors: DC motors with motor driver (TB6612FNG)

Sensors: Infrared (IR) sensors or camera (for advanced vision-based tracking)

Power Source: Li-ion or rechargeable battery

Chassis: Robot frame with wheels

Other Components: Resistors, LEDs, jumper wires, and PCB board

# Working Principle

The IR sensors detect the black line on a white surface (or vice versa) by measuring light reflection.

The microcontroller processes the sensor data and determines the direction.

The motor driver controls the movement of the motors accordingly to keep the robot on track.

If the robot deviates, it adjusts its speed to correct the course.

# Installation & Setup

Assemble the robot chassis and attach all components.

Connect the sensors, motor driver, and microcontroller as per the circuit diagram.

Upload the provided Arduino/Python code to the microcontroller.

Calibrate the sensor sensitivity if needed.

Place the robot on the track and test the movement.

Code

The control logic is written in Arduino C/Python. Below is a basic snippet for Arduino:

Applications

Automated guided vehicles (AGVs)
